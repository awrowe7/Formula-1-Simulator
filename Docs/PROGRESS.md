This file will contain your Progress Report. Answer the prompts below to evaluate how well you were able to meet your intermediate goal(s).

### In a numbered list, briefly restate the intermediate goal(s) from your Project Proposal.

1. Rough outline of the code and classes/functions needed by Friday the 28th
2. Construct the docstrings and some of the code by Wednesday the 3rd
3. Have at least half of the coding done by Friday the 5th
4. Complete the project by the end of reading period (May 9th)

### Which goal(s) were you able to acheieve?

I'm currently ahead fo schedule as I have a little over half of the code done already, a goal I had set for this friday. I think I'm on track to complete the project by this weekend, or at least the end of this weekend. 

### Which goal(s) were you not able to acheieve? 
#### Please describe what problem(s) you faced, and indicate if you are still stuck on any particular step.

I haven't fallen short of any of my goals. Looking forward to continued progress. 

### Reminder: The final project is graded differently than the lab assignments. Review the bundle criteria in the "Grading for the Final Project" webpage and describe your progress towards completing the bundles you are aiming for.

I think I have met each of the 5 bundlesm barring the project being done of course. I tried to impliment as much as I could from the differnent labs we have done over the course of the semester. All I need now is to complete the project

### In a few sentences, descibe your next steps.

The next step is to clean up any menu issues I'm having and then complete the race sequence. I am currently trying to brainstorm solutions to a couple issues, such as how to include tyre wear, how to impliment pit stop interactions with the user, and how to display things that happen during the race. Tomorrow will serve as a testing day for different solutions. Hopefully I can find one that works well and move forward with it. Hoping to be done no later than this Sunday night!
