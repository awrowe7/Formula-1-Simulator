# Project Proposal
### Due: Monday April 24, 2023 @ 11:59PM

This file will contain your Final Project Proposal. Answer the prompts below to outline your project. If you are struggling to think of ideas, refer to the [Project Overview](https://cs.oberlin.edu/~cs150/final-project/part-1/) for suggestions.

### (1) What is the title of your project?

- Formula 1 Simulator 

### (2) In 3-5 sentences, summarize what you want to accomplish. Provide enough detail so that I can understand your main idea, but try to keep things concise.

- A main menu where users select a team to race as, a circuit to race on, and the conditions of the race, and a strategy. Then, a simulation will run of the race using the 10 team profiles and calculating different events throughout (ex. yellow flag, red flag, pit stop error, crash, weather)

### (3) Try "backwards-designing" from your main idea and draft your program overview. See previous labs and/or coding demos for examples.
1. Inputs: What will you request from the user?

- Team, circuit, conditions, and strategy 

2. Computation: How are you transforming the inputs into something else? What data types could be helpful for managing information in the program? What functions will you create/use to produce specific effects?

- Variables for calling different attributes
- Dictionaries and classes for the teams
- Classes for the circuits
- Lists for the start and finish orders

3. Outputs: What will you present to the user?

- Image of the cicuit with special symbols for handling special events
- Further input to the user if other issues arise 

### (4) In a numbered list, briefly describe your intermediate goal(s) based on your program overview.
Note that you will reflect on how well you were able to meet your intermediate goal(s) in your Progress Report.

1. Have a rough outline of the code and classes/functions needed by Friday the 28th
2. Construct the docstrings and some of the code by Wednesday the 3rd
3. Have at least half of the coding done by Friday the 5th
4. Complete the project by the end of reading period (May 9th)

### (5) How excited are you about this idea?

- Super excited. Speaking with Prof. Molly about some ideas and some things other people have thought of really helped and made me realize "How did I not think of this before?!" This should be a project I can really be pationate about and enjoy doing.
