# Documentation
### Due: 11 May before 9:00pm

This file will contain your project Documentation. Fill out the relevant sections to document your code.

## Summary
#### Briefly describe your program and what it does.
- In its most simple form, this program runs a probability based simulation of an F1 race. The user can pit the constructor they wish to 'play' as and all others will be controlled by a 'bot'. 

## Main File
#### What is the "main" file for your program, i.e. what should I run first?
- Formula1.py

## Example Usage
#### Provide examples of how the user should run your program.
- The user should run Formula1.py, follow the prompts, and make their choices about the race. All variations of the race results are caused by the user's decisions and randomization each iteration through. 

## Input
#### Describe any input(s) required from the user.

Inputs:
- Constructor
- Circuit
- Weather
- Strategy
- Tyre selections
- Pitstop decisions
- Hitting 'enter' to begin things (or really any key for that matter)

## Output
#### Describe any output(s) produced by your program.

Outputs:
- Image of the ciruit the user chose
- Image displaying the weather the user chose
- A grid showing the results of Qualifying as well as each lap of the race

## Known Issues
#### Describe any known bugs, including workarounds to keep your program running.
None
